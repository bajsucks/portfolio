                I'm a professional fullstack Lua/Luau scripter with over 2 years of experience.<br>
                I would like to explicitly point out my vast experience in backend; Profilestores, Vector math, CFrame math - All of that I can handle without any issues.<br>
                Below you can view my previous works that involved scripting. Most of them are solo projects, and some of them never made a public release.<br>
                For projects that did release, a link to the experience will be provided.<br><br>

                This is a demo of a simple wave simulation made with voxels.<br>
                Initially this project was supposed to be a <i>normal</i> wave simulation, but at the time,<br>
                Roblox's Editable Mesh APIs were still in beta, and I couldn't apply them.<br>
                Scripts in this place make extensive use of Parallel Luau (multithreading), which drastically improved performance and allowed for larger grid scales.<br><br><br>

                This project is inspired by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/433340/Slime_Rancher/" style="color:aquamarine" target="_blank">Slime Rancher</a> <i><small>(a <a href="http://www.monomipark.com/" style="color:aquamarine" target="_blank">Monomi Park</a> game)</small></i> and was supposed to be sort of a port of it in Roblox.<br>
                Video (1) is the newer version, a rewrite of sorts.<br>
                Video (2) is an older version with more mechanics and overall content.<br><br><br>

                A simple tycoon game I made in 2 or 3 days, based around the triangle factory worker meme.<br>
                Abandoned, but playable enough so I released it as a demo.<br>
                This game was made purely as proof to myself that making tycoon games is easy. It really is.<br><br><br>

                This is my second game.<br>
                This project was made as an attempt to make my own version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/" target="_blank" style="color:aquamarine">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</a> in Roblox.<br>
                A lot of inspiration for this was also taken from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/1242235469/ball-and-axe" target="_blank" style="color:aquamarine">ball and axe</a>, an already existing roblox adaptation of that game.<br><br>

                While it wasn't in development for long, a lot of backend stuff was actually finished on the project:<br>
                A functioning data structure, lobbies, fights, win/loss/stalemate system, end of match rating, inventory, ui animations, attack patterns, rewards, weapon types,<br>
                weapons themselves, damage mechanic, parties, a leveling system, shop, an admin menu and many more was done.<br><br><br>
